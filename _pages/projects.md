### Open source, cross simulator, large scale cortical models in NeuroML 


#### Google Summer of Code 2022 (INCF)

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/gsoc_logo.jpeg" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

1. Verify, improve and test the original model code in NEURON
2. Convert the published network model involving channels, cells, and connectivity developed in a simulator-specific format to NeuroML
3. Document and illustrate the baseline expected behavior of the model and share them across Open Source Brain repositories
