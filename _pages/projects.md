## Open source, cross simulator, large scale cortical models in NeuroML 


### Google Summer of Code 2022 (INCF)

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/gsoc_logo.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

1. Verify, improve and test the original model code in NEURON
2. Convert the published network model involving channels, cells, and connectivity developed in a simulator-specific format to NeuroML
3. Document and illustrate the baseline expected behavior of the model and share them across Open Source Brain repositories

### Reward and punishment-related changes in behavior during a 2AFC task in mice

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/rrs.png" width="200" height="200" hspace="30">

1. Used [IBL datasets](data.internationalbrainlab.org) to analyse and model the 2AFC task
2. Streak distribution isn't random but rather influenced by task's difficulty, learning and motivation
3. Trained and evaluated a logistic regression model to predict the correctness of the next choice
